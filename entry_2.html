	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px;">  Another Monday, another first meeting with a <s>teacher</s>, I mean facilitator. It’s not the first time that an event made me question why I enrolled in this course, but it is the one that had the most impact during my time in this college. Fresh meat, that is what I am, a novice, a beginner, a newborn baby in this big and intimidating world of research. I don’t know what the others truly felt but the vibe of the room suggested that we have the same thought; “Ang Gwapo ni Sir <3.” Kidding aside, I can tell that the whole class was very nervous. Well, who can judge us? A distinguished gentleman with a commanding aura arrives in the room, I surely got intimidated.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px;">  The first instruction was for those who did not wear a uniform to go outside. Those who remained in the room got to arrange the chairs for a more modern classroom look. The good thing is that the class livened up when those who are not in uniform got to sing in front of the class to get included back. It was really fun for me because I was in uniform, if I did not buy one the night before it would have been a very embarrassing moment for me. This blog entry is getting a little sidetracked but who cares, this is my blog.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px;">  Now the main event, research research research. Not expensive but very expensive. Not tiring but very tiring. Not reading a little but reading a lot of journals, published works, and related documents. The very handsome and youthful facilitator discussed the basics of research with the class, asked questions, and explained different topics. I listened intently and exclaimed to myself “huh?”. Nonetheless, the information shared in the classroom gave me enlightenment, excitement, and of course anxiety. During this first meeting, I learned a lot of new things in the world of research and it helped me prepare for the worst for our thesis in the future. I hope I can apply all the proper steps in crafting a reputable and publishable paper and present it to a research conference, as the saying goes; "Aim for the stars, if you fail, you will land on the moon."</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px;">  Fresh meat, that is what I am. I just hope that I can be utilized in a delicious dish (conduct a great thesis) after this course and not end up being rotten ("dili makagraduate").</p>
