        <h2 style="margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size: 42px;">Fresh Meat</h2>
	      <p></p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  Another Monday, another first meeting with a <s>teacher</s>, I mean facilitator. It’s not the first time that an event made me question why I enrolled in this course, but it is the one that had the most impact during my time in this college. Fresh meat, that is what I am, a novice, a beginner, a newborn baby in this big and intimidating world of research. I don’t know what the others truly felt but the vibe of the room suggested that we have the same thought; “Ang Gwapo ni Sir <3.” Kidding aside, I can tell that the whole class was very nervous. Well, who can judge us? A distinguished gentleman with a commanding aura arrives in the room, I surely got intimidated.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  The first instruction was for those who did not wear a uniform to go outside. Those who remained in the room got to arrange the chairs for a more modern classroom look. The good thing is that the class livened up when those who are not in uniform got to sing in front of the class to get included back. It was really fun for me because I was in uniform, if I did not buy one the night before it would have been a very embarrassing moment for me. This blog entry is getting a little sidetracked but who cares, this is my blog.</p>

	     <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  Now the main event, research research research. Not expensive but very expensive. Not tiring but very tiring. Not reading a little but reading a lot of journals, published works, and related documents. The very handsome and youthful facilitator discussed the basics of research with the class, asked questions, and explained different topics. I listened intently and exclaimed to myself “huh?”. Nonetheless, the information shared in the classroom gave me enlightenment, excitement, and of course anxiety.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  In my past experiences during Junior High School and Senior High School, I also dabbled in making a capstone project and writing research papers. These challenges allowed me to dip my toes into this subject and spark my curiosity. The process of creating a capstone project was both demanding and rewarding. It required me to think critically, conduct extensive research, and collaborate with my peers to develop a project that showcased our group’s comprehensive understanding of the subject we have chosen. Although it was far from being a good and publishable project, it gave me good experience in planning, logistics, gathering data, and teamwork. From brainstorming ideas to refining the final presentation, every step was an invaluable learning experience that honed my analytical and problem-solving skills. Writing papers also became a regular part in my school years during high school. Our teachers gave us tutorials and templates to follow, they also shared their personal experiences in creating research papers. These papers allowed me to explore diverse topics, delve into the existing body of knowledge, and contribute to the discourse surrounding various subjects. The rigorous nature of research paper writing taught me the importance of meticulous research, credible sourcing, and connecting the findings of related papers to your own argumentation. Through countless hours spent in the internet (“Thank you Modern World!”), I discovered the power of the contributions from researchers around the world. Looking back, I am grateful for the opportunities I had during Junior High School and Senior High School to participate in these intellectually stimulating projects. They not only broadened my academic horizons but also shaped me into a more knowledgeable and well-rounded individual.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  During this first meeting, I reminisced my past experiences and I also learned a lot of new things in the world of research and it helped me prepare for the worst for our thesis in the future. I hope I can apply all the proper steps in crafting a reputable and publishable paper and present it to a research conference, as the saying goes; "Aim for the stars, if you fail, you will land on the moon." As I move forward in my educational journey, I carry with me the lessons learned from these experiences, eager to embrace new opportunities to explore, create, and contribute to the world of knowledge.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  Fresh meat, that is what I am. I just hope that I can be utilized in a delicious dish (conduct a great thesis) after this course and not end up being rotten ("dili makagraduate").</p>
