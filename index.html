        <h2>Entry #1: Fresh Meat</h2>
	      <p align="justify">	Another Monday, another first meeting with a <s>teacher</s>, I mean facilitator. It’s not the first time that an event made me question why I enrolled in this course, but it is the one that had the most impact during my time in this college. Fresh meat, that is what I am, a novice, a beginner, a newborn baby in this big and intimidating world of research. I don’t know what the others truly felt but the vibe of the room suggested that we have the same thought; “Ang Gwapo ni Sir <3.” Kidding aside, I can tell that the whole class was very nervous. Well, who can judge us? A distinguished gentleman with a commanding aura arrives in the room, I surely got intimidated.</p>
