        <h2 style="margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size: 42px;">My Realization: What’s the Next Step?</h2>
	      <p></p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  The <b>CIC</b>apehan program served as a platform for us to showcase our progress and share our research journey with a wider audience. It was a chance to receive valuable feedback, engage in thought-provoking discussions, and foster intellectual growth. The excitement mingled with a touch of nervousness as we prepared to present our work, knowing that our efforts would be scrutinized, but also recognizing the opportunity to receive constructive criticism that would ultimately strengthen our research.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  Well, I got news to share. My proposed title received an average score of 4.33. The validation and recognition of my research topic being approved as a thesis for the next semester filled me with a sense of accomplishment and motivation. However, along with this achievement came the unexpected appointment as the leader of our research group. The realization of being entrusted with such a responsibility brought forth a mix of emotions. Doubts and uncertainties crept into my mind as I questioned my ability to lead a team. I've always been more introverted and reserved, not naturally inclined towards outgoing or social interactions. How could I effectively guide a group of individuals with diverse personalities and strengths?</p>
	      
	     <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;"> Looking back at the journey before the <b>CIC</b>apehan, I realized the growth and transformation that had taken place within me. The initial simple proposal had evolved into a comprehensive study, enriched by the insights gained from reading, collaboration with peers, and the guidance of our mentors. The experience not only deepened my understanding of the subject matter but also honed my research skills and instilled in me a sense of intellectual curiosity.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  From our past discussions in the classroom, I learned the basics and other useful information regarding the conception of a research study. Talks with my classmates also sparked some ideas in my head on how I can proceed with my study. I give them all my thanks for inspiring me and helping me continue this journey.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  To prepare myself for this new role, I plan to engage in self-reflection and personal development. I will seek opportunities to enhance my communication skills, build stronger connections with my team members, and cultivate a positive team culture that encourages open dialogue and mutual respect. Moreover, being a leader is not about having all the answers or being the most outgoing person in the room. It's about fostering a supportive and collaborative environment where each team member can thrive. Embracing the diversity of personalities within the group can lead to a rich exchange of ideas and perspectives, ultimately enhancing the quality of our research project.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  So what is the next step? In the off semester, hopefully, we can start preparing for our thesis. My research title: “Reading Evaluation System for Elementary Level Learners using Machine Learning” can be spiced up with some creativity so that it can be more eye-catching. The data collection or preparation for conduction must be organized so that progress will go smoothly. Of course, I still need to read more literature on how to improve the machine-learning aspect of my study. From feature extraction and model creation, my learning does not stop. Finally, in the future, I hope my team can successfully deploy this study and publish a great paper.</p>

	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  As I move forward, I am reminded that I am not alone in my academic pursuits. The support and camaraderie I have found among my peers and mentors have become an essential part of my academic life. Together, we share the joys, challenges, and triumphs of the research journey, continuously pushing each other to excel and grow. While I may feel apprehensive about leading a team, especially given my introverted nature, I understand that diversity in personalities can bring unique strengths and perspectives to the table. I am ready to embrace the challenge, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment that encourages the growth and development of each team member. I am excited to embrace the responsibilities of leadership, collaborate with my future team, and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in my chosen field. This journey has shown me that with passion, perseverance, and the support of a community, we can overcome any challenges and achieve remarkable results. Thank you for this semester my CIC family.</p>
