	      <p></p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;"> It’s here, the culmination of our hard work this semester. <b>CIC</b>apehan is a 2-day program on May 11 – 12, 2023, as the event approached, anticipation filled the air, and a mix of nervousness and excitement coursed through our veins. It was the moment we had been working towards all semester long, and the time had finally come to showcase our research progress. With the spotlight on our class scheduled for the afternoon of the first day, we were eager to present our findings and demonstrate how far we had come since the initial proposal phase.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  Before that, let me share what I did before Armageddon. You guessed it! I did a lot of reading, my browser had an excessive amount of tabs open, and I was full of caffeine. In the last phase, it was only a simple proposal of my topic. This time, we needed to continue our study up to Chapter 3. I dedicated countless hours to immersing myself in relevant journals and scholarly articles. The pages became my companions, guiding me through the intricacies of my research topic and providing valuable insights to support my study. Especially on the machine learning part, I really needed to understand how to achieve the results that I was aiming for. Good thing there were published studies that have a similar concept to mine. It was through this extensive reading that I deepened my understanding of the subject matter and expanded my perspectives, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent phases of my research.</p>
	    
	     <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  In writing Chapters 1 to 3, you need to follow a guideline. That is why we were provided a style sheet to base our output. Chapter 1, the Introduction is the opening chapter of a research paper that sets the stage for the entire study, laying a solid foundation for what lies ahead. This section serves as an introduction, where you present the background, rationale, and objectives of your research. It is here that you engage readers, enticing them to embark on a journey of knowledge alongside you. To begin, provide a compelling overview of the research topic, capturing the attention of your audience and highlighting its relevance in the larger context of your field. Then, articulate the research problem or question that your study aims to address. Clearly define the scope and boundaries of your research, ensuring a focused and manageable investigation. Next, establish the significance of your research by identifying the gaps or limitations in the existing literature. Showcase your understanding of the subject matter and explain how your study will contribute to filling those gaps, advancing knowledge, or proposing innovative solutions. Lastly, outline the objectives of your research, setting clear expectations for what you aim to achieve in the subsequent chapters.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  In Chapter 2, the spotlight turns to the extensive exploration of existing literature. This section serves as a comprehensive review of relevant research, theories, and scholarly works, providing a critical analysis of previous studies conducted in your field. Start by identifying key themes or concepts that underpin your research topic. Closely examine academic journals, books, and reputable sources to gather a comprehensive understanding of the existing body of knowledge. In Chapter 3, your research project takes a significant leap forward as you outline the methodology that will guide your investigation. This section provides a detailed explanation of the methods, procedures, and techniques you will employ to collect and analyze data. In my case, I decided to use a quantitative and experimental research design. I elaborated on my data collection plan and the method that I am going to utilize for this study. Thanks to the hours I spent reading related studies, I think I came up with a feasible method of achieving my desired outcome.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  The <b>CIC</b>apehan program started with three talks from invited professors from around the globe. I was actually very interested in their topics, especially Ma’am Kristine Mae Adlaon’s presentation on the implementation of NLP. Her topic greatly inspired me since my study will also deal with the collection of speech samples. I took note of her team’s great lengths just to collect data from far places to preserve their language. They even made applications that are fascinating to use. Overall the morning event was very fun (the snacks were good too), and it helped me take my mind off what is coming later.</p>

	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  As the afternoon arrived and we took our place on the stage, the culmination of our hard work was evident. The hours spent poring over literature and refining our writings led us to this moment. With nervousness and excitement, we presented our research titles, now armed and expanded with more information fueled by our passion for knowledge. I presented my research title to the panelists and the audience. I shared how I thought about the study and the methods that I plan to employ. The panelists provided suggestions and feedback that are very much appreciated. As the curtains closed on our presentation, a sense of fulfillment washed over me. Regardless of the outcome, I knew that I had poured my heart and soul into this research endeavor. The journey had been arduous, but it was worth every moment of dedication and perseverance. Now, with valuable feedback in hand, I was prepared to take my study to new heights, armed with the knowledge that this was just the beginning of a lifelong pursuit of knowledge and academic excellence.</p>
