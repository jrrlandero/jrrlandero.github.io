        <h2 style="margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size: 42px;">Start of my Research Journey: Initial Proposal</h2>
	      <p></p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  The start of your research journey in college can be both exciting and intimidating. It's a chance to delve into unexplored territories, contribute to the body of knowledge, and showcase your intellectual prowess. However, before diving into the sea of data and analysis, there is a crucial step that sets the foundation for your research project: presenting a research proposal. A research proposal serves as a roadmap, outlining the objectives, methodology, and significance of your study. It provides a clear and concise overview of your research topic, enabling the reader to grasp the essence of your project. Moreover, a well-crafted proposal demonstrates your commitment, research skills, and ability to articulate your ideas effectively.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;"> Our class was instructed to individually prepare a research topic idea and present it in front of everyone. This mini proposal will allow our classmates to critique and give suggestions for our proposed topics. Ultimately, the final decision will fall on the class’ facilitator if our topics will be approved or not approved. The basis for the approval will be the novelty of the study, its significance, and whether or not the study will be feasible with the proposed methods, time frame, and the financial capacity of the student.</p>
	     <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  I read a lot of literature and browsed the internet for ideas for my topic. I even tried asking ChatGPT for input. In the end, I got an idea for my topic from my brother and mother. My mother is an English elementary teacher in a barrio school in Digos City. She noticed that students in early grades had difficulty pronouncing and reading English words or sentences. My brother said to me that this would be a good topic to create a thesis in the future. So with a focus in hand, I got to work on my research proposal.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  To make your research proposal comprehensive and organized, structure it into distinct sections. Start with an engaging introduction that provides background information and context for your study. Follow it up with a clear statement of the problem or research question you aim to address. This sets the stage for the significance of your research topic and its relevance in the broader academic landscape. By clearly stating the problem or research question you aim to address, you create a solid foundation for the rest of your proposal. Then, outline your research objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. Clearly articulate the specific goals you want to achieve through your study, ensuring they are aligned with the problem statement and contribute to filling the research gap you identified. Detail the methodology you plan to employ, including data collection methods, sampling techniques, and data analysis approaches. Justify your choices by explaining how they align with your research objectives and the feasibility of implementation. Additionally, include a brief review of relevant literature to demonstrate your understanding of existing research and articles, then based on your understanding, use the related information to support your research. Finally, emphasize the significance and potential impact of your research on your targeted individuals or groups. You can also showcase the novelty of your chosen research and explain how it is different from past research and what you are contributing new to the existing body of knowledge. During the presentation of your research proposal, be prepared to receive feedback and suggestions from the panelists. Embrace this opportunity to refine your research topic and strengthen your proposal. Consider their perspectives and incorporate constructive criticism where applicable. </p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  Sheesh, that was a lot of work! But I finally managed to create a simple research proposal with the temporary title: “Reading Evaluation System for Elementary Level Students using Machine Learning.” I was so ready to present it to our class, however, on that particular day I was the only one available and willing to present in front. The facilitator of the class decided to postpone the presentation to another time when there are at least three presenters. That’s where my nervousness worsened, there was a mental health break, holy week, holidays, and intramurals. During the days with no class, I thought about how can I improve my proposal or if I should change it. This only made my nerves and confidence worse. That’s why I did nothing, I relaxed and joined fun activities with the thought “Mag research proposal pa man diay ko (I still have to do the research proposal)” in the back of my head.</p>

	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  April 19 came, it was time to present what I made weeks before. I was nervous but I already accepted my fate. Everything happened fast, I did my proposal, my three classmates were the panelists and they provided feedback, then the facilitator of the class also asked questions and gave feedback. My research topic was accepted. Well, time to move on to the next phase of my research journey.</p>
