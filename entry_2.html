	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  If you are Bisaya you probably think the title is something naughty or misleading. However, having an eye-catching title can make or break the reach of your paper.  Research titles containing words or terms like; MapaIoT, LubotIoT, DSA-CIG-IOT, and IoTurn can sound very shocking, especially in a professional setting but, believe it or not, these papers have won many awards for the university. Our very handsome and youthful facilitator flexed these papers during the class and of course, we laughed out loud. Nonetheless, this caught our attention and made us very intrigued by the contents and results of these studies. This is one important component in crafting your future paper. </p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  This made me think of possible attention-grabbing titles for our future thesis. It does not need to sound boring or plain. I need to think outside of the box for something creative, but needless to say, I also need to make it related to our future study. When it comes to formulating attention-grabbing titles for our future thesis, creativity becomes the key to unlocking the reader's curiosity. Gone are the days of dull and monotonous titles that fail to captivate the audience. In today's dynamic world, a well-crafted title not only reflects the essence of our research but also entices readers to delve deeper into our work. Out of hundreds or even thousands of papers published every day, you need something unique to make yourself stand out.  We can draw inspiration from various sources, such as literature, art, pop culture, or even intriguing scientific concepts. By infusing our title with a touch of creativity, we can instantly capture the attention of potential readers and engage them on a deeper level. However, while we strive for creativity, it's crucial to strike a balance and ensure that our title remains relevant to our future study. The title should serve as a gateway to the core theme and objectives of our research, providing a glimpse of what lies ahead. By maintaining this connection, we can attract both the curious reader seeking unique perspectives and the scholarly audience looking for a focused investigation. A good research title is not the only thing you need to write a highly publishable paper. Papers that win awards need to have a good base, and it all starts with addressing a question of interest to the community. What and why does something happen? How should one proceed to have something done, and what should someone do? Your research should answer these questions and provide a viable claim or solution. </p>

	     <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  So how do you find a topic to formulate a research title or study? Research does not happen in the classroom. Finding a captivating and meaningful topic for a research study can be an exhilarating yet daunting task. It requires stepping beyond the boundaries of the classroom and venturing into the vast realm of the real world. While classroom lectures and discussions provide a solid foundation of knowledge, true research emerges when we explore the uncharted territories and uncover the mysteries that lie beyond the walls of our university.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  One approach to discovering a compelling research topic is to immerse yourself in your field of interest. Attend conferences, join professional networks, and engage with experts who are at the forefront of cutting-edge research. By staying up-to-date with the latest advancements and discussions in your field, you can identify gaps in knowledge, emerging trends, or unresolved questions that pique your curiosity.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  Another approach is just by living your daily life. Observing your surroundings and real-life experiences can draw inspiration that can spark your engine. Challenges faced in your community, global issues that are shared in the news, or personal encounters with something you are passionate about. Anything can motivate you to delve deeper and contribute to society.</p>
	      <p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 0px 100px 25px 100px; font-size:24px;">  There is a treasure trove of research possibilities that are waiting to be unlocked. Groundbreaking ideas can come from the combination or intersection of different interests. You can combine your primary area of interest with other fields and create a very novel study. Remember, research is a journey of discovery. It requires patience, perseverance, and a genuine desire to contribute to the advancement of knowledge. So, step out of the classroom, embrace the richness of the world around you, and let your curiosity guide you toward a research topic that ignites your passion and resonates with your intellectual aspirations. Maybe you can generate the next novel research and catch the attention of many readers with your creative title.</p>
